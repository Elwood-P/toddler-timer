# Toddler Timer

> A timer inspired by my toddler, who is too young to tell the time. I wanted a timer that would display a visual percentage used of the total time, rather than a traditional base-60 clock. This timer features large numbers that count down, helping my child to develop an understanding of what various durations feel like in minutes.  
> One of several projects undertaken to refresh my knowledge of vanilla JavaScript.
